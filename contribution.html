                  You can learn about Newtonian physics from our bumper swing,
                  or why not travel back in time and meet our resident Woolly
                  Mammoth? Our exhibits are designed to be accessible for
                  interested minds, so make sure you come ready to learn and
                  explore.

                  We also have the Young Stars club which meets once a week on a
                  Saturday between 10:00 and 13:00 where you'll get to explore
                  and experiment with our team of experts.

                <p>
                  During the school holidays we run special holiday clubs where
                  you can join other children your age to go on a journey of
                  discovery. Each holiday we pick a new theme to explore. To
                  find out more about the holiday club and how you can join,
                  send us a message.

                  As a teacher, you have a crucial role in inspiring the next
                  generation of scientists. We offer special guided tours and

                  and curriculum requirements.

                  Our educational programs are designed to complement classroom
                  learning and provide hands-on experiences that bring science
                  to life. Contact us to arrange a visit or to learn more about
                  our educational resources.
