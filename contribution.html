              <p>
                Are you a young person looking to learn more about science? Come
                on down to our museum, there's plenty to see and do.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can learn about Newtonian physics from our bumper swing, or
                why not travel back in time and meet our resident Woolly
                Mammoth? Our exhibits are designed to be accessible for
                interested minds, so make sure you come ready to learn and
                explore.
              </p>
              <p>
                We also have the Young Stars club which meets once a week on a
                Saturday between 10:00 and 13:00 where you'll get to explore and
                experiment with our team of experts.
              </p>
              <p>
                During the school holidays we run special holiday clubs where
                you can join other children your age to go on a journey of
                discovery. Each holiday we pick a new theme to explore. To find
                out more about the holiday club and how you can join, send us a
                message.

                As a teacher, you have a crucial role in inspiring the next
                generation of scientists. We offer special guided tours and
                workshops for school groups, tailored to different age ranges
                and curriculum requirements.

                Our educational programs are designed to complement classroom
                learning and provide hands-on experiences that bring science to
                life. Contact us to arrange a visit or to learn more about our
                educational resources.
