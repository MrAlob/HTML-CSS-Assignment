              <h2>Cosmology</h2>
              <p>
                Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition,
                'The Sky Above Us', explores the night sky and what we can see
                and know about the universe around us. We'll locate the various
                constellations and galaxies that can be seen and learn a bit
                about the early navigators who used the stars to travel by.
              </p>
              <p>
                Follow the journey of our solar exploration: from early Arab
                traders, to Galileo's telescope, to the latest exploration of
                the planets in our solar system.

              <h2>Evolution</h2>
              <p>
                For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with
                the question of our origins. Where do we come from and how did
                we get here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we
                have had a framework for exploring and understanding our place
                in this world.
              </p>
              <p>
                Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species
                we know today have evolved over time. You can also take some
                time to meet a few of the creatures who didn't survive,
                including our Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of
                dinosaurs too.

                From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in
                biology are offering us unique insights into the great wonders
                of the tiny world.

                For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their
                quality of life much improved, thanks to the growth of our
                understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore
                the history of medicine and take a look at some major
                breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin and the
                first heart transplant.

                The information revolution is here and robotics and artificial
                intelligence are the science of the future. From useful home
                applications of AI to industrial uses of robotics, the future is
                here. You can even say hello and shake the hand of Rob the

                As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the
                planet, the more important it becomes that scientists explore
                how to create a sustainable future not just for humans but for
                the whole planet.

                In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers we
                currently face including global warming, extinction of species,
                and pollution. But we also focus on the positive ways we can all
                contribute to a brighter future.

              <p>
                On loan from the NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam, the
                Energetica exhibition is coming to the Community Science Museum.
                It’s a series of installations that allow visitors to experience
                the power of the elements as we harness them. From solar energy
                powering lighting, to ‘Wind Island’ that shows how turbines are
                able to use and control wind to create power.
