# Community Science Museum


A responsive website for the Community Science Museum, an interactive science museum designed for primary and middle school children (ages 7-15) and families with young children. This project represents my first front-end development assignment using vanilla HTML and CSS.

## About This Project

This was my first major assignment in front-end development studies, where I learned to create a fully functional, responsive website from scratch using only HTML5 and CSS3. The project challenged me to implement modern web development practices including semantic HTML, responsive design, and accessibility features without relying on any frameworks or libraries.

## Features
